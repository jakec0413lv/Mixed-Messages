## Mixed Messages

# Introduction

This program is designed to output a randomized text output of three different types - Joke, Fun Fact, or Motivational Quote. 

I intend to later adapt it for use on an interactive website, to add some simple flair to a site. The type of text can be modified for the type of site. For example, a personal site likely would only use motivational quotes, or substitute Jokes/FunFacts for other options.

Creation of the project was driven by a desire to hone my Javascript skills, to help me on my road to become a Full Stack Developer!

“Don’t limit yourself. Many people limit themselves to what they think they can
do. You can go as far as your mind lets you. What you believe, remember, you can
 achieve.” – Mary Kay Ash
